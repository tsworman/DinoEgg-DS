# DinoEgg-DS
A Yoshi Clone for the Nintendo DS.

The old.nds files are complete and work. The latest and the source code reflects a version where wi-fi multiplayer was attempted to be added.
The addition was never completed but much of the work to make the connection is done. The attemp was to support split screen with the second player able to drop immovable eggs on the first.

The Old makefile is what was used before the wifi support was added.
